Hello World tutorial
====================

The purpose of this tutorial is to explain how to add our SDK as a dependency of an Swift project and how to create the `Core` object that all our APIs depends on.

Start by taking a look at the `Podfile` file, and use the "pod install" command to create Helloworld.xcworkspace and build the app

The user interface will only display the `Core`'s version, but in the next tutorial you will learn how to use it to login your SIP account.
