Basic chat tutorial
====================

This tutorial will demonstrate how to send and display a simple SIP message containing either text or an image (but it works the same for any kind of file).

Note that for file transfer, a file transfer server is required. In this tutorial we'll use the one at `https://www.linphone.org:444/lft.php` that we use in our own linphone-android and linphone-iphone apps, but you can get its [source code](https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/flexisip-http-file-transfer-server) and deploy your own.

Messages sent in this tutorial are standard SIP messages, so no matter the SIP proxy server you are using it should work, unlike the next [advanced chat tutorial](https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/tutorials/-/tree/master/ios/swift/6-AdvancedChat).
