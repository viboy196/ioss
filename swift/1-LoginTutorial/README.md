Account login tutorial
====================

Now that you have set up Linphone-SDK in a Swift project, let's start using it.

We will see how to login on a SIP server using the `Core` object instanciated in the previous tutorial. As always, you will have to start with a "Pod install" to generate the xcworkspace for this app.

If you don't have a SIP server yet, you can create an account for free using our [free SIP service](https://subscribe.linphone.org/).

Once you'll be logged-in, you'll be able to continue to the next tutorials to make calls and send messages.
