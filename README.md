IOS tutorials
====================

Tutorials are written in swift, but the same features can be achieved in objective-C.

Tutorials are numbered 0 to 6, and we recommend you to read them in that order as features from previous tutorials are sometimes used in the next ones, such as account login.

Each tutorial is a full project, so you can generate your Xcode workspace with Cocoapods, build it and deploy it on a real device or an emulator.

Code is being kept as short and simple as possible, and comments explain how and why things are being done. 

Full swift API is available [here](http://linphone.org/snapshots/docs/liblinphone/latest/swift).
